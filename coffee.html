<h1>Coffee tastes better when it is strong!</h1>
<h1>Do you agree?</h1>
<div id="d1">
 <p>Though coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history tied closely to food traditions around the Red Sea. The earliest credible evidence of coffee drinking in the form of the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen from the mid-15th century in Sufi shrines, where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to current methods. The Yemenis procured the coffee beans from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries and began cultivation. By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to Europe. In the 20th century, coffee became a global commodity, creating different coffee cultures around the world.</p>

<h1 id="h7">TYPES</h1>
<p>Coffee is a drink prepared from roasted coffee beans made from seeds of Coffea plant species. It is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content, and is one of the most popular drinks in the world.</p>
<ul>
    <li><h3>Types of bean:</h3>There are four primary types of coffee beans we’ll be discussing here: Arabica (Coffee arabica), Robusta (Coffee caniphora), Liberica (Coffee liberica), and Excelsa (Coffee liberica var. dewevrei). Let’s discover what differences define these various types of coffee.One point to note about the popular but sensitive bean is that its taste has a reputation of being diminished a bit when it is served cold or blended with milk or creamer. While that may be the case, it’s fair to say the difference probably won’t be noticeable when you’re adding some additional flavor to the drink anyway.

        </li>
    <li><h3>Types of roast:</h3><p>Though the bean itself matters, coffee gets a lot of its aroma and flavor from the roasting process. The length of the roasting process can affect many things, including the body, acidity, and flavor of your tasty beans. To help you expand your coffee knowledge, we’ve put together this handy guide to the four major types of coffee roasts.The four types of coffee roasts are light roast, medium roast, medium-dark roast, and dark roast. Each of these roast levels has a different aroma, appearance, and flavor. Keep reading to learn all about the four types of coffee roasts!

    </p></li>
    <li><h3>Types of grind:</h3><p>Although fine ground beans will extract quite a bit of flavour, this isn’t ideal when it comes to making certain brews. Different coffee brewing systems require different types of coffee grinds, and it also comes down to personal taste!Here are some general guidelines for choosing the best grind, primarily depending on your brew method. However, your personal preferences will win out in the end. Use these guidelines and adjust the fineness or coarseness of your coffee grinds as your taste buds dictate.</p></li>
    <li><h3>Decaffeinated coffee</h3><p>Decaffeination removes about 97% or more of the caffeine in coffee beans. A typical cup of decaf coffee has about 2 mg of caffeine, compared to a typical cup of regular coffee, which has about 95 mg of caffeine.If you are wondering whether the decaffeination process itself is safe, the answer is yes. All four methods are safe, and once the caffeine is removed (well, at least 97% of it), the beans are washed, steamed, and roasted at temperatures that evaporate the liquids used in decaffeination.</p></li>
